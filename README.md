# Quiz
Create and take quizzes. Questions and answers are shuffled each time. I created this to help my wife study for her grad school classes.

## Languages/Frameworks used:
* Python
  * argparse
  * typing
* SQLAlchemy

## To Do:
* Add ability to take a quiz and see score instead of just printing one
* Add ability to see which topics need more studying
  * Add a class table (e.g. Biology 1127)
  * Add a section table that is a child of the class table (e.g. Chapter 1)
  * Make the question table a child of the section table
* Create a GUI (QT)
* Create a web front-end (Flask)
